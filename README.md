I had trouble originally installing github but once succesffully downloaded I was able to figure out how to create my ssh key, I had to go through the terminal to check to make sure my connection was legit and then began testing with committing and pushing. I am just beginning to understand how the system works and with more practice I will hopefully be able to become more comfortable with it.
